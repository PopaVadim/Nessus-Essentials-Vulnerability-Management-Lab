<h1>Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a walkthrough of how I created A Virtual Machine environment using VMWare running Windows 10. I did this project to gain experience with Nessus Essentials and learn how to scan for vulnerabilities and remediate them. This project will showcase two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.
<br />

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>CMD</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>VMWare Fusion Pro</b>
- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2 align="center">Program walk-through</h2>
<br/><br/>

<b>We start our Lab with downloading and installing our Vulnerability Managment Software, Nessus Essentials.</b> <br/>

<b>After the installation is finished we log in with the newly created Nessus Account.</b> <br/><br/>

<b>Now the next step will be creating a new Windows Virtual Machine for Vulnerability Scanning inside of VMWare Fusion.

<br/><br/>

<b>Next we will go to the Processors & Memory tab for our newly created Virtual Machine inside of VMWare settings. Here we will readjust the hardware settings for the Processor, RAM ,and Network Adapter.</b>

<br/><br/>

<b>Now it is time to attach our ISO and go ahead and install our Windows Virtual Machine.<b/>

<br/><br/>

<b>We gonna open the Command Prompt and run the ipconfig command to find out the IP address on our newly created Windwos Virtual Machine. The IP address will be needed for our Vulnerability scans on Nessus. Below you can see that the IP address of our VM is 192.168.1.197<b/>

<br/><br/>
 
<b>I tried to ping the Virtual Machine from the Host Machine to check if we can communicate with the VM. We do this since if we can't ping the machine then Nessus won't be able to runt the scan either. Below we can see that the pings are timming out which means the Host machine can't enstablish a connection with the VM at the moment.</b> <br/>
<b>The Host Machine couldn't communicate with the VM because it has the Firewall active which blocks all the connection attemps. This is a good thing but not for the purpose of our Vulnerability Scan Lab. Therefore, we will have to disable the firewall. This is acceptable only for this specific task only in this envoirment.<b/>

<br/><br/>

<b> In order for me to be able to communicate with the VM I will have to access Windows Defender Firewall Proprieties on our Virtual Machine.</b> 

<br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Then we go to Domain, Private ,and Public Profiles Firewall and change the state status to off of all three then save the settings. After we should be able to communicate with the VM.</b>

<br/><br/>

<b>Since the Firewall is disabled, I tried to ping from the Host Machine the Virtual Machine again and this time it was successful.<b/>

<br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Now is time to create our first Nessus scan. We will choose the Basic Network Scan, Give it a name ,and give it the target that Nessus will have to scan. In our case is our Virtual machine and it has the IP address 192.168.1.197
 See all the steps below</b>

<br/><br/>

<b>Bewlow we can see the results of our Scan. We have 32 results, 1 medium sevirity vulnerability and 31 info.</b>

<b>Target Credential Status By Authentication Procotol Info was triggered because we did not provide credetials for this scan.<b/>
